                is a unit of ownership of a corporation. Simply put, stocks
                are tiny pieces of a company you can buy or sell.

                may buy or sell shares from thousands of different
                companies. These orders take place online, and share 
                prices change daily.

            </h1>
            <p class="learn-card-p">The way you can make money in the stock 
                market is by buying and selling shares at different prices. For 
                example, if you buy a stock at $5, it raises in value, and you 
                sell it at $11, you make a total of $6 (before tax).

            <h1 class="learn-card-header">4) Good and bad habits.</h1>
            <p class="learn-card-p">An important rule to follow is to only invest 
                with money you can afford to lose. Don't go buy stocks with next
                month's rent, there's no guarantee it will raise in value! <br> Something
                else to keep in mind is to never put all your eggs in one basket. Don't 
                put all your money into one stock, you don't want to lose all of your
                money if one stock doesn't perform well.
